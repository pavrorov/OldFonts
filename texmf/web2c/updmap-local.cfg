# 
# The full updmap.cfg is generated by concatenating updmap-hdr.cfg with
# all the Map and MixedMap lines from an installation, possibly
# appending a local configuration file.
#
# To make local customizations to the map files, please use of the
# following methods:
#
# 1) call 
#       updmap-sys --enable Map=foo.map
#    for each map file.  (Or MixedMap instead of Map, if your font has
#    both Metafont and outline definitions.)  See the updmap --help
#    documentation.
#
# 2) add your local map entries to the file
#       TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
#    and then call
#       tlmgr generate updmap
#    which will concatenate updmap-local.cfg to the end of the final
#    updmap.cfg.  (You can override the local.cfg file location with the
#    --localcfg option; see tlmgr --help.)
#
# If you use either of these methods, your local adaptations will be
# preserved when tlmgr updates the installation or this config file.
# Manual edits to updmap.cfg may be lost on update.

#
# There are two possible entries: Map and MixedMap. Both have one additional
# argument: the filename of the map file. MixedMap ("mixed" means that
# the font is available as bitmap and as outline) lines will not be used
# in the default map of dvips if dvipsPreferOutline is false. Inactive
# Map files should be marked by "#! " (without the quotes), not just #:
#
#! Map      euler.map
#! MixedMap cm.map

Map oldf-ps.map
Map pala-ps.map
