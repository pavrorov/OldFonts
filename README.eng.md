OldFonts Font Package
---------------------

The package gives a LaTeX user access to several traditional
Russian font families used for book typesetting. They include
*Academy*, *Elizabeth*, *Latin*, *Usual New* and few others.
Fonts contain modern Russian characters as well as those used in
the 19th century Russian writing. The package also contains
supplementary files that allow use of "Adobe Minion Pro" and 
"Palatino  Linotype" font families with LaTeX.

One can hardly expect that a person not familiar with Russian
will ever be interested in this package. So all documentation
is written in Russian. Address to README.* and INSTALL.* in this
directory.
